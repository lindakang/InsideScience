<p>Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), established in 1876, is a centennial global pharmaceutical powerhouse dedicated to developing and marketing medicines and vaccines across various therapeutic areas, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, oncology, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>The company boasts a diversified product portfolio featuring market-leading drugs such as <strong>Trulicity</strong> (dulaglutide) for diabetes, <strong>Verzenio</strong> (abemaciclib) for breast cancer, and <strong>Taltz</strong> for psoriasis. However, its current growth is primarily driven by its blockbuster GLP-1 receptor agonists: <strong>Mounjaro</strong> (tirzepatide) and <strong>Zepbound</strong> (tirzepatide).</p>
<p>Lilly's current market valuation reflects strong investor confidence, largely due to its competitive advantage in the weight loss and type 2 diabetes markets. While the entry of competitors beyond Novo Nordisk poses a challenge to maintaining market share over the next three years, Lilly is aggressively expanding its pipeline beyond weight management.</p>

<h3>History and Key Milestones</h3>
<p>Eli Lilly was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Civil War veteran. After serving in the Union Army (1861–1865), he worked in several pharmacies before establishing his own manufacturing business.</p>

<h4>Early Development and Innovation (1876 – 1940s)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1876:</strong> Colonel Eli Lilly founded the company after a brief partnership with John F. Johnston. The initial focus was on high-quality drugs, including quinine for malaria.</li>
    <li><strong>1880s:</strong> Introduced innovations such as gelatin-coated pills/capsules and fruit-flavored or sugar-coated tablets for easier ingestion.</li>
    <li><strong>1923: Commercialization of Insulin.</strong> In collaboration with the University of Toronto, Lilly became the first company to mass-produce insulin (Iletin), establishing its leadership in diabetes care.</li>
    <li><strong>1940s:</strong> Pioneered the mass production of penicillin for Allied forces during World War II.</li>
